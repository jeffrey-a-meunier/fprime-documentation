Tutorial: System setup
========================
This tutorial is designed to help you get your system set up for developing F' applications.
It ensures that you have all the utilities and tools installed and that you can create and build an F' project,
and that you can run the F' GDS (ground data system) server, and then view the GDS data in a web browser.

Here you'll create a new project called ``Spacecraft`` that will be used throughout the subsequent tutorials.
