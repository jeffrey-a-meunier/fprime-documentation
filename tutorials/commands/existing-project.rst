Start with the Spacecraft project
=================================

This project extends the ``Spacecraft`` project by adding a component to it.
You must complete that project now if you have not done so already

Project directory
-----------------
Open a terminal window and change into the ``Spacecraft`` project directory.

Source the environment
----------------------
If the Python virtual environment is not active, then enter this command in the Spacecraft directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    source venv/bin/activate

Your terminal prompt should resemble this:

.. code-block:: text

    (venv) jeff@ubuntu-vbox:~/workspace/Spacecraft$
    ^^^^^^                              ^^^^^^^^^^
