Tutorial: Events
================
This tutorial is designed to introduce you to events in F'.
Recall that a *command* is how a user on the ground communicates with a running F' application.
An *event* is how a running F' application communicates information back to the ground.

In this tutorial you'll create some events and then use those events in each of the commands in order to relay information back to the GDS.
