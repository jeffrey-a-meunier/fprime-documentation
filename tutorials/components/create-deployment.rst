Create a deployment
===================

NO, THIS WAS DONE IN THE PREVIOUS TUTORIAL. SKIP THIS.

Change into the project root directory (``~/workspace/Spacecraft``) and enter this command:

.. code-block:: bash

    fprime-util new --deployment

It will ask you for the name of the deployment.
Use ``SpacecraftDeployment``.
Use the default for any other questions it asks you.

You should see this output:

.. code-block:: text

    [INFO] Cookiecutter: using builtin template for new deployment
    deployment_name [MyDeployment]: SpacecraftDeployment
    path_to_fprime [./fprime]: 
    [INFO] New deployment successfully created: /home/jeff/workspace/Spacecraft/SpacecraftDeployment
