You don't have the C version of NameMapper installed!
=====================================================

When building a deployment, this error message is displayed:

.. code-block:: text

  [100%] Built target SpacecraftDeployment
  You don't have the C version of NameMapper installed! I'm disabling Cheetah's useStackFrames option as it is painfully slow with the Python version of NameMapper. You should get a copy of Cheetah with compiled C version of NameMapper.

It needs to be fixed.
