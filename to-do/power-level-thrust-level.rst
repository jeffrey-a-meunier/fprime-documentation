Power level vs thrust level
===========================
In the Thruster component I call it the *power level percent*.

In the ThrusterController component I call it the *thrust level percent*.

Rename *thrust level* to *power level*. That's more correct.

(The output thrust level on a real thruster does not necessarily directly follow the input power level.)

Make the changes in each tutorial that refers to these variables.
