Member variable names
=====================

In the Thruster.hpp/.cpp file the two member variables I created are called ``_powerStatus`` and ``_powerLevelPercent``.
Those variables should be called ``m_powerStatus`` and ``m_powerLevelPercent``.

This is to name the variables according to JPL's requirements.

Change these files accordingly:

* Thruster.hpp
* Thruster.cpp
* tutorials/events
* tutorials/ports
* tutorials/parameters
* tutorials/telemetry
